HashTable review

Dictionary ADT
    (fastest to slowest)
    hash table O(1)
    BST O(logn)
    AVL tree O(height)
    linear dictionary O(n)

reasons not to use hash table
    need to save memory
    need to use getItems() or getKeys() frequently
    if use case simple or data set small
    if don't have good hash function
    if want to find smallest/largest key (because hash tables don't order the keys)

graph
    way to represent relationship between entities
    G = (V, E) where
        V = set of vertices
        E = edges
    
    measuring running time of an algorithm w/ graph as input
        n = |V| = # of vectices
        m = |E| = # of edges
    
    applications of graphs
        e.g.
            maps
            social networks
    
    ...


    path
        sequence of edges where destination of each edge is source of next one
    
    connected
        two vertices connected if exists path between them
        graph connected if evrey pair of vertices connected
    
    simple
        if graph has no self loops and no duplicate edges
    
    tree is graph

    graph ADT
        template 3 things
            V vertex label type (must be unique)
            E edge label type (duplicates allowed)
            W edge weight type (usually numerical)
