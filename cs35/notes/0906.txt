classes and objects in C++

    objects combine {data, functionality}
    class describes a type of object
    an object is a particular instance of a class

why does C++ organize things this way?
    easy to interact with
    keep data protected


methods
    getters
    setters
    constructor
        no return type

stack diagrams with objects 
    every ... includes "this" variable
