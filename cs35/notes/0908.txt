compiling many files
    example of having to write many lines
        clang++ -std=c++11 -c point.cpp -o point.o
        clang++ -std=c++11 -c main.cpp -o main.o
        clang++ -std=c++11 main.o point.o -o main
    Makefile

object-oriented programming (OOP)
    hierarchical relationships
        same type different examples
        common things but differnent characteristics
        e.g. buildings (dorm; dining hall; library)
        e.g. dog (Schnauzer; Husky; Bernese)
            base : bark; name (features common to all dogs)
            derived : schnauzer(haircut); husky(number of sleds pulled); bernese(contents of rescue barrel)

        parent/base/super class <-> child/derived/sub class

inheritance
    class inheritance
    syntax (abstract class)
        class Dog {
            public:
                virtual void bark() = 0;
        }


encapsulation
    private


polymorphism
    refers to how a single variable can act as if it is different types
    in inheritance relationships, a pointer of something
