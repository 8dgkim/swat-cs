    c++

-----

polymorphism and destructors

new & delete
    heap memory
    allocates & deallocates memory to/from heap
    new -> dynamic memory allocation which puts var on heap memory
    delete -> destroys array non-array(pointer) objects created by new expression
        pointer to object not destroyed
        value or memory block pointed by pointer is destroyed

valgrind
    checks memory leak

evaluating algorithms
    empirical analysis
        want to compare versions to find which is most efficient
        - run some experiments and time them
            command : time ./program_name
        - vary the size of the array
        clock time is not the cleanest measure hard to control conditions for equal runs
        can only run on a limited set of values
        must implement each algorithm to test it

    theoretical analysis
        - abstract away from a particular language
        - analyze how much work the algorithm requires
            work = # of steps
        - count the # of steps in an algorithm
        - focus on key steps
            is_sorted : key step is comparison between elements
        - let n represent the size of the problem

big-O definition, theoretical analysis
