Search algorithm
    last time used stack
    this time how about queue?
        in the notes
    
    difference in how search works
        queue : breadth-first search; finds shortest(fewwest hops) path
        stack : depth-first search; can be better for certain application

Stack & Queue


Induction Proof
    problem
        consider some algorithm with double-nested loops
    proof outline
        1. base case
        2. inductive hypothesis
        3. inductive step
    why this works as a rigorous & convincing argument
        domino analogy
        only with integers
    
    e.g.
        in the notes & GootNotes
        show LHS = RHS
    
    e.g.
        prove factorial function is correct by induction
        begin by stating a recursive invariant
        base case
            n = 0;
            n = 1;
