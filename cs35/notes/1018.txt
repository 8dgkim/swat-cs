Missed class for swim test

binary search
    repeatedly reduce the size of search space by half
    worst case
        O(log2(n))
    
tree
    collection of nodes
    recursive

binary tree
    either
        empty
    or
        consists of a node that contains links to 2 trees below it (left & right)

terminology
    node
        data (key)  
        pointers to left & right subtrees
    children
    parent
    root
    size
    leaf
    depth
    height

binary search tree (BST)
    binary tree w/ special property governing all keys stored within nodes
    property true at all nodes & helps w/ searching

    property
        all keys in left subtree < key at that node
        all keys in right subtree > key at that node

    adding a new key
        search; add when reach empty tree
    
    best possible structure = full-packed tree
        # nodes in full BT of height h = 2^(h + 1) - 1
    
    if tree n nodes
        best case height: O(log2(n)) fully packed
        worst case height: O(n) basically linked list
